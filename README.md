# Tic-Tac-Toe Poker
Scroll down for the video demo of the game play.

An Android game I made 10 years ago (2012). It is a really simple game that combines the gameplays of both **Tic-Tac-Toe** and **Poker**.

I have only updated the manifest files to make the game work again, plus changed the package name only. The program code still keeps the looks like **10 years ago**.

I got this idea from my old friend and started to develop the game when I was in college, but was never published at any place until today (Dec, 2024).

I may not add new things to the project anymore, because it uses old technologies that are 10 years already and I don't want to rewrite everything. But I may still update it to make the game at least work.

## Features

The game is really simple, it combines the gameplays of both Tic-Tac-Toe and poker. Other than just placing marks on the board, players **pass poker hand to opponent** and let them place the card in a cell for you, and the one who has a **higher rank of hand** in the same cell occupy the cell.

Player who get 3 marks lined up, or occupy 5 cells win the game.

The flow of a game:

1. Player selects cards and pass them to the opponent.
2. Opponent select a cell to place the cards
3. If there are cards in the cell already, compare the ranks of both pile of cards.
   - The player who has high rank of card can place a coin on the cell
4. If someone lined up 3 coins, or won 5 cells already, the game end
   - Otherwise, switch turn and go back to step 1.

The game supports the following modes:

- Vs CPU mode
- Hot-seat mode
- Wifi mode (Haven't tested the mode yet)

## Installation

Just pull the code from Github and run it in IntelliJ.

If you want to play it on a real phone, build it as an APK file. Remember to allow "Unknow Source"
